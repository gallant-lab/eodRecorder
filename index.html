<a name="1-getting-started" class="anchor" href="#1-getting-started"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1. Getting Started</h3>

<h4>
<a name="dependencies" class="anchor" href="#dependencies"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dependencies</h4>

<p>The EOD Recorder requires a National Instruments Data Acquisition Device and the NI-DAQmx Base Software available on the National Instruments website.</p>

<h4>
<a name="sample-rate--length" class="anchor" href="#sample-rate--length"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sample Rate &amp; Length</h4>

<p>Before running the application, select values for Sample Rate and Length. The application will send those values to the DAQ which will continuously gather waveforms of the specified length at the specified rate. When you are ready to view the waveforms, click the arrow in the top left corner to run the application.</p>

<h4>
<a name="live-data-mode" class="anchor" href="#live-data-mode"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Live Data Mode</h4>

<p>After initializing, the application begins in Live Data mode. This mode allows you to view waveforms in real time. A waveform is displayed and discarded after a new one is collected. </p>

<h4>
<a name="threshold" class="anchor" href="#threshold"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Threshold</h4>

<p>You may update the threshold while the application is running. The multiplier below the threshold scale represents the digit being modified. For instance, when the multiplier is set to 10E 0, moving the threshold slider modifies the ones digit. Similarly when the multiplier is set to 10E -1, moving the threshold slider modifies the tenths digit. The threshold contains up to two digits of precision in the inclusive range of 0 and 9.99.  </p>

<a name="2-recording-eods" class="anchor" href="#2-recording-eods"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2. <a name="%E2%80%9Drecording%E2%80%9D">Recording EODs</a>
</h3>

<h4>
<a name="capture-data" class="anchor" href="#capture-data"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Capture Data</h4>

<p>To record an EOD, click the “Record EOD” button to the right of the display. This button sends the application to Capture Data mode, where waveforms are collected and discarded until the waveform crosses the specified threshold. When the application finds a trigger, the waveform is displayed.</p>

<h4>
<a name="comments" class="anchor" href="#comments"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Comments</h4>

<p>When text in comment fields (Species,  Location, Recording Temperature, etc.) are stored as text that appears before waveform data in the EOD file. These comments will be displayed as text when the file is opened.</p>

<h4>
<a name="gain" class="anchor" href="#gain"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Gain</h4>

<p>The values on the Gain knob correspond to those on the BMA-200 Bioamplifier. Because the points of the waveforms are rounded and stored as integers, each point is multiplied by the gain programmatically before saving. When displayed, the points of the waveforms are divided by the square of the gain.</p>

<h4>
<a name="coupling" class="anchor" href="#coupling"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Coupling</h4>

<p>Coupling can be modified before saving the waveform. Off indicates AC, and on indicates DC.</p>

<h4>
<a name="polarity" class="anchor" href="#polarity"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Polarity</h4>

<p>Each point in the waveform is negated when the polarity button is switched. This can be switched before saving and each point will be saved as its negative. Whether the waveform has been polarized or not will be stored in the EOD file. A previously saved EOD file may be opened and the polarized waveform can be displayed by switching the polarity button. Switching the polarity when analyzing data will change the display, but will not change the file itself.</p>

<h3>
<a name="3-saving-options" class="anchor" href="#3-saving-options"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3. <a name="%E2%80%9Dsaving%E2%80%9D">Saving Options</a>
</h3>

<h4>
<a name="choosing-a-file-name-and-path" class="anchor" href="#choosing-a-file-name-and-path"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Choosing a file name and path</h4>

<p>Before saving, remember to choose a directory and unique name for the file by clicking the folder icon by the path input. Saving waveforms to preexisting files will append to and not replace the old file.</p>

<p>1. Save &amp; Close – Saves the current wave to the file specified and returns to Live Data mode.<br>
2. Save &amp; Continue – Saves the current waveform to the file specified, and collects a new waveform. When clicked again, the wave will be appended to the same file.<br>
3. Discard &amp; Collect New Wave – Discards the current waveform and collects a new wave without resetting the file path.<br>
4. Discard &amp; Start New EOD – Deletes the file specified, discards the current waveform, and returns to Live Data mode.   </p>

<h3>
<a name="4-timed-option" class="anchor" href="#4-timed-option"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>4. <a name="%E2%80%9Dtimed%E2%80%9D">Timed option</a>
</h3>

<p>The timed option allows the user to automatically collect new waveforms. It is important to ensure that the computer does not go to sleep, otherwise the program will stop running. The timed option is available after collecting a wave. Once a wave is collected, add comments and set the polarity, coupling, and gain. Click the “Timed” button. A pop-up will appear so that you may choose the file path and name. Click the OK button. Enter the amount time you would like the EOD Recorder to wait in between waveform collection and the number of waveforms you would like to collect. Once you click “OK”, the program will run until all waveforms are collected.</p>

<a name="5-opening-previously-recorded-files" class="anchor" href="#5-opening-previously-recorded-files"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>5. <a name="%E2%80%9Dopening%E2%80%9D">Opening previously recorded files</a>
</h3>

<p>Click the “Open EOD” button.  Select the file you would like to view. The waveform is displayed with units of voltage on the y-axis and seconds on the x-axis. The y-coordinates are obtained by dividing the coordinates in file by the gain specified by the file.</p>
